Abbots call upon him as a medical examiner, detective, doctor, and diplomat.

135,Fatal,13,19,"When I started work on FATAL AFFAIR, I knew I wanted to write about a female Washington, D.C. police detective named Sam Holland, so the first thing I did was research the Metropolitan Police Department. Whoa! I quickly learned the department is enormous with levels and layers and complexities I couldn't begin to bring to my story without weighing it down with details the reader would find tedious at best. Being the ""seat-of-the-pants"" writer that I am, I pressed on with the book as I pondered how to deal with this world-building challenge. Over the course of the book, a department of my own making began to take shape. There's a chief, deputy chief, detective captain, detective lieutenant, detectives, patrol officers, a medical examiner, etc. The chief of the real-life MPD is a woman. I would've loved to have done that in my books, but I needed the chief in the Fatal Series to be a crony friend of Sam's dad. Her father, a disabled former deputy chief, plays a big role in this series, so his character helped me to inform and shape the others. Sam's struggles to contend with being the daughter of a fallen hero while working for men she used to call ""Uncle"" is a central theme of the series. I also tried to give each of Sam's fellow officers context in their relationship with her. The chief was her Uncle Joe when she was a kid. The deputy chief is still a close friend of her father's, as is the detective captain who serves as Sam's mentor. Her lieutenant is her nemesis. He believes she's gotten where she is in the department because of who she is and sets out to cause her all sorts of trouble as the series unfolds. Within Sam's closest group of coworkers, her partner serves as a kid brother of sorts, while other colleagues fill a variety of roles in her personal and professional life. Over the course of the series, I hope to develop each of these relationships by giving these characters stories that keep them front and center in Sam's life. So I created my own version of the Metropolitan Police Department. I note in the acknowledgements that it is a department of my own making and is in no way intended to mirror the real thing.",https://www.goodreads.com/series/55369-fatal

The stories also regularly feature other characters, including Captain Ryan Feeney, Detective Delia Peabody, Detective Ian McNab and Dr. Charlotte Mira. The series is ongoing and will go on as long as Roberts desires to write it; however, she has famously stated that the series will never contain one of Eve and Roarke's children, as the series will end with Eve's eventual pregnancy--which is nowhere in sight at the current count. Please note: Each book in this series is a whole story with a beginning and an ending, however there may be minor references to events that occurred earlier in the series. Therefore, with respect to the mystery alone, the books can be read out of order, if desired. However, like any long series that focuses on a core group of characters, there are various relationship changes that develop more naturally when the full length novels are read in the order in which they were published. http://www.indeath.net/wikiindeath/index.php/Main_Page - includes spoilers Eternity in Death (#24.5) was published between Innocent in Death (#24) & Creation in Death (#25).

She is the heroine of Warren Adler's acclaimed mystery series, which began with American Quartet, chosen by the New York Times as best in its genre for the year it was published. Since then she has appeared in: * American Sextet * Immaculate Deception * Senator Love * The Witch of Watergate * The Ties That Bind * Death of a Washington Madame Fiona Fitzgerald is the daughter of Senator Fitzgerald (D-N.Y.). She is in her mid-thirties and a Sergeant in the Homicide Division of the Metropolitan Washington Police Department. She has been raised in the heady social circles of the Washington establishment and is familiar with all the important players in government, the Congressional and White House crowd, Ambassadors, and the hard-core members of Washington's upper crust. Her childhood friends and schoolmates have become important political players. These wide ranging contacts give Fiona enormous access into the behind-the-scenes action that lies beneath the surface of the power structure. It is a mystery to many of her peers why she has chosen a ""blue collar"" profession in a mostly black police force. But to her, the reasons are clear. It is her way of fighting injustice and penetrating the facade of chicanery and manufactured imagery that characterizes many in the Washington establishment. Fiona is also single, though she has had numerous love interests and her relationships between lovers are continuously dissected and explored. She is attractive and tough enough to cope in a macho racist male-dominated world and can operate with equal dispatch in all layers of Washington's highly structured ""class"" society. She has not, as yet, been able to establish a truly satisfying relationship with a man, although she is constantly searching for such a permanent relationship. She is a woman driven by strong passions, both physically and intellectually. Nor does she suffer fools with toleration. She is often outspoken and opinionated and is constantly battling the intrigues of male domination in both her work and social life. She lives in a beautiful house in Washington and is in demand as a date by important Washington types. Because of her political background, she has enormous insight into the machinations of ""power-people"" -- their foibles and motivations, their obsessions and vulnerabilities-- insight that assists her enormously in her crime solving activities. Because she is so tied in with the establishment, she is, invariably, charged by her superiors to solve those crimes which deal with people in high places. She has had a number of partners, both male and female, all richly characterized. She has a special relationship with her boss, the over-worked ""eggplant,"" whom she both admires, reviles, and ultimately respects. Her closest friend and confidant is the Chief Pathologist of the Washington MPD, an older black man and a widower, who helps her deal with and understand her deeper impulses. http://www.warrenadler.com/title-fitzgerald.shtml",https://www.goodreads.com/series/44571-fiona-fitzgerald-mysteries

The Penn Cage series ""involves all the quintessentially Southern themes--family, racial violence, 'miscegenation,' honor, hypocrisy, and the quest for justice in an unfair society...""-- A chronological order is not necessary, but certain books are linked by common characters or themes, and they do have a sequence in time. Of my ""Natchez"" or ""Mississippi"" novels, the ""Penn Cage"" novels are a subcategory. I've tried not to write a series character, for reasons I'll discuss elsewhere, but Penn has cropped up as a minor character in other Natchez books, and seems to be developing a life of his own. Of the rest, Mortal Fear, Dead Sleep, 24 Hours, and Sleep No More -- while all set in Mississippi (or New Orleans)--- stand completely alone and can be read at any point. If you have just read Turning Angel, you should next read The Quiet Game, the novel in which Penn Cage first appeared, and which many readers believe is my best book. Blood Memory was written before Turning Angel, and Penn's father Tom Cage appears there in a supporting role, but I would read ""Blood Memory"" after ""The Quiet Game,"" not before.

In Amy Lynn Golden Angel, she answers the question, ""who am I,"" both personally and professionally. This is a straight up spy thriller that takes up right where Amy Lynn leaves off. However, it spans a period of only nine days. In The Lady of Castle Dunn, we find a woman secure in herself and her job. She is however still haunted by events from her past and continues to overcome while moving forward. The third book is my favorite. So yes, the reading order is the publication order.

You will know why the people she surrounds herself with, do the the things they do. I also use a lot of actual history and meld it with my fictional characters. I'll let you in on something.
